## üë®üèª‚Äçüíª Running Locally

**Recommended extensions for VSCode:**

- [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss).
- [Astro](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=astro-build.astro-vscode).

1. Clone or [fork](https://github.com/jetboom/personal-site/fork) the repository:

```bash
git@github.com:jetboom/personal-site.git
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Run the development server:

```bash
pnpm start
```

## üìê Configure

- Edit the configuration file **src/site.config.ts** for the basic site metadata.
- Update the **astro.config.mjs** file at the root of the project with your own domain.
- Modify the files in the **/public** folder:
  - favicon
  - robots.txt -> update the Sitemap url to your own domain
  - open-graph -> the open-graph is the image that will be displayed when sharing the site link. For posts, the preview image is the post cover.

## üìÑ Adding a post

Adding a post is as simple as adding a .md or .mdx file to the posts folder at the path **src/content/posts**. The filename will be used to create the slug/URL of the page.

For example, if you have a file named **jsx-and-react.md**, it will be transformed into: **http://yourdomain.com/post/jsx-and-react/**

## üìù Activating draft mode

To activate draft mode, add the property **draft: true** to the file, and it will no longer be displayed on the post.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Frontmatter

## Required properties:

- Title
- Description
- pubDate
- image (post cover)
- category

## ü¶ô Tina CMS

By default, this template comes pre-configured with Tina CMS.

Now you can create your posts directly from the CMS without the need to do it manually.

If you decide to use Tina, it's not necessary to add any properties to the Markdown files, Tina does it automatically.

The documentation for Tina CMS can be found [here](https://tina.io/docs/)

> Tina is completely optional, and you can remove it, and it will still function in the same way.

## Optional properties:

- draft (no need to include it, by default it's false)
- tags

> The schema for posts is located at src/content/config.ts. You can modify any parameter, for example, by adding a maximum of 80 characters for titles: title: z.string().max(80).
> For more information, refer to the zod documentation.

## üßû Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
